=================================

As the RunEngine processes instructions, it creates "Documents," plain Python
dictionaries organized in a specified but flexible way. These Documents contain
the data and metadata generated by the scan. Each time a new Document is
created, the RunEngine passes it to a list of functions. These functions can
do anyting: store the data to disk, transfer the data to a cluster,
update a plot, print a message, etc.
